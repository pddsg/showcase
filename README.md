### Showcase Repository

This repository represents a small collection of scripts and projects I've developed in a manufacturing and QC environment. You'll find a mix of JMP scripting language code with traces of Python and SQL added to the toolkit. Most of these scripts are used for data analysis, process optimization, and a bit of dashboarding.

Feel welcome to browse around. There's a Jupyter notebook that walks through some Python examples, and the JMP scripts often have SQL, and in one case even Python, tucked inside. This is a fair assessment of how I’ve been refining my data skills from industrial analytical chemist to where I am today.
