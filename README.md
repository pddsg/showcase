### Showcase Repository

This repository represents a small collection of scripts and projects I've developed in a manufacturing and QC environment. You'll find a mix of JMP scripting language code with traces of Python and SQL added to the toolkit. These scripts are used for data analysis and dashboarding of QC, as well as manufacturing sensor data.

Feel welcome to browse around. There's a Jupyter notebook that goes through some Python examples. The JMP scripts often have SQL, and in one case Python, tucked inside. This is a fair assessment of how I’ve been refining my data skills from industrial analytical chemist to citizen data scientist.

There are always too many low-hanging fruits. And yes, I use AI for Python and SQL, because AI is a good teacher. For JSL I rely heavily on the [JMP User Community](https://community.jmp.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/15435)
