### Showcase Repository

This repository represents a small sample of hand-picked scripts and projects I've developed in a manufacturing and QC environment. The original library is much larger but kept private for IP reasons. You'll find a mix of JMP scripting language code with traces of Python and SQL added to the toolkit. These scripts are used for data analysis and dashboarding of QC as well as manufacturing sensor data.

There's a Jupyter notebook that goes through some Python examples. The JMP scripts often have SQL, and in one case Python, tucked inside. The [Bulk Oil Stability Calculator](https://github.com/pddsg/showcase/blob/main/Bulk%20oil%20stability%20calculator.jrn) and [AKBM Google Cloud View Opener](https://github.com/pddsg/showcase/blob/main/AKBM%20Google%20Cloud%20view%20opener.jmpaddin) are best experienced in connection with a JMP license. Several scripts in this repository are actively used in [Aker BioMarine](https://www.akerbiomarine.com/) at the time of writing, but the stability calculator is possibly the most ambitious and impactful piece of software here.

Feel welcome to browse around. This is a fair assessment of how I’ve been refining my data analysis and modelling skills to shape myself from industrial analytical chemist to citizen data scientist.

There are always too many low-hanging fruits. And yes, I use AI for Python and SQL, because AI is a good teacher. For JSL I rely heavily on the [JMP User Community](https://community.jmp.com/) - here's [my user profile](https://community.jmp.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/15435).
