### Showcase Repository

This repository is a small collection of scripts and projects I've developed in a manufacturing and QC environment. You'll find a mix of JMP scripting language code (my first scripting love) and some Python and SQL work that I've been adding to my toolkit. Most of these scripts are used for data analysis, process optimization, and a bit of dashboarding.

Feel free to browse around! There's a Jupyter notebook that walks through some Python examples, and the JMP scripts often have SQL tucked inside. This is just a snapshot of how I’ve been blending my data skills across different tools — enjoy!
